# NewsUp üì∞

NewsUp is a mobile application built with React Native and Expo, designed to deliver the latest news updates. It features a modern user interface with animations, intuitive navigation, and various interactive components.

## ‚ú® Features (inferred from dependencies)

*   **Cross-Platform:** Runs on iOS, Android, and Web thanks to Expo.
*   **News Aggregation:** Fetches and displays news (likely using an external API via Axios).
*   **Smooth Navigation:** Utilizes React Navigation and Expo Router for screen transitions.
*   **Engaging UI:** Incorporates Lottie animations for a richer user experience.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Includes modals and date/time pickers for user input.
*   **Iconography:** Uses Vector Icons for clear visual cues.
*   **Typed Codebase:** Developed with TypeScript for better maintainability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

1.  **Node.js and npm/yarn:**
    *   Node.js (LTS version recommended, e.g., v18 or v20). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
    *   npm is included with Node.js.
    *   Yarn (Optional, but often preferred for React Native projects): `npm install --global yarn`
2.  **Expo CLI:**
    *   Install globally: `npm install --global expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`
3.  **Git:**
    *   For cloning the repository. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
4.  **Watchman (macOS/Linux recommended):**
    *   For macOS: `brew install watchman`
    *   For Linux: Follow instructions on the [Watchman installation guide](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).
5.  **(Optional) Mobile Development Environment:**
    *   **For iOS:** Xcode (macOS only). Install from the Mac App Store.
    *   **For Android:** Android Studio. Download from [developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Make sure to set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) or connect a physical Android device with USB debugging enabled.
6.  **(Optional) Expo Go App:**
    *   Install the "Expo Go" app on your physical iOS or Android device from the App Store or Google Play Store. This allows you to run the app on your device without needing a full native build setup initially.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd newsup
    ```
    *(Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository)*

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    It's generally recommended to use Yarn with React Native/Expo projects, but npm will also work.
    ```bash
    # Using Yarn (recommended)
    yarn install

    # OR Using npm
    npm install
    ```
    *Note: The `newsup: "file:"` dependency in your `package.json` implies a local file dependency. Ensure this path is correctly configured if it's a local package you're developing, or remove it if it's an error.*

3.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # Using Yarn
    yarn start

    # OR Using npm
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the Metro Bundler and open a development server interface in your web browser.

## üì± Running the Application

Once the development server is running, you have several options:

*   **On an iOS Simulator (macOS only):**
    *   Press `i` in the terminal where Metro Bundler is running.
    *   Or, from the browser interface opened by `expo start`, click "Run on iOS simulator".
    *(Requires Xcode to be installed and configured)*

*   **On an Android Emulator/Device:**
    *   Press `a` in the terminal where Metro Bundler is running.
    *   Or, from the browser interface, click "Run on Android device/emulator".
    *(Requires Android Studio to be installed and an emulator running, or a physical device connected with USB debugging enabled)*

*   **On a Physical Device using Expo Go:**
    1.  Ensure your computer and your physical device are on the **same Wi-Fi network**.
    2.  Open the **Expo Go** app on your iOS or Android device.
    3.  Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or in the Metro Bundler web interface.

*   **In a Web Browser:**
    *   Press `w` in the terminal where Metro Bundler is running.
    *   Or, from the browser interface, click "Run in web browser".

## üìú Available Scripts

The `package.json` defines the following scripts:

*   `npm start` or `yarn start`:
    Starts the Expo development server (Metro Bundler).
    ```bash
    expo start
    ```

*   `npm run android` or `yarn android`:
    Starts the Expo development server and attempts to launch the app on a connected Android device or emulator.
    ```bash
    expo start --android
    ```

*   `npm run ios` or `yarn ios`:
    Starts the Expo development server and attempts to launch the app on an iOS simulator (or connected device if configured).
    ```bash
    expo start --ios
    ```

*   `npm run web` or `yarn web`:
    Starts the Expo development server and attempts to launch the app in a web browser.
    ```bash
    expo start --web
    ```
